### ✨ Highlights
- **Objective**: Estimate admission chances from profile metrics
- **Tech**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn
- **Artifacts**: Notebook and dataset included for quick experimentation

---

### 📁 Project Structure
- `Admission prediction.ipynb` — End-to-end workflow: EDA → feature prep → modeling → evaluation
- `admission_predict.csv` — Dataset used for training and evaluation

---

### 🚀 Quick Start
1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open `Admission prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter (or VS Code + Python extension)
3. Run all cells to reproduce results

Suggested environment (install as needed):
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

---

### 🧠 Approach (At a Glance)
- Exploratory data analysis and data cleaning
- Feature engineering and scaling where appropriate
- Model training (e.g., linear models / tree-based models)
- Evaluation using regression/classification metrics as suitable for the target

---

### 📊 Outputs
- Performance metrics and charts embedded in the notebook
- Insights to guide feature impact on admission likelihood

---

### 🗂️ Notes
- Ensure the dataset path in the notebook points to `admission_predict.csv`
- Results will vary depending on model choice and hyperparameters
